The goal of this project was to analyze and visualize a dataset containing environmental parameters (Temperature, Humidity, and Pressure) using Google Colab. The visualizations included a line graph, bar chart, and pie chart to better understand the relationships, distributions, and contributions of the data points.
For line graph, each parameter (Temperature, Humidity, Pressure) was plotted as a separate line. The x-axis represented the index, while the y-axis represented the parameter values. This visualization highlighted fluctuations and trends, such as spikes in temperature or consistent pressure levels. Temperature showed significant variability, while Pressure appeared more stable.
 A bar chart for Temperature revealed dominant values such as 46 and 45, which stood out as major contributors.
 Values like 46 and 45 contributed the most, while smaller and negative values had minimal impact in the pie chart
